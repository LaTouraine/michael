<h2 class = "storyTime">But first, some background:</h2>
<p>Michael was born in the state of New Mexico, raised in 5 other states and lived in yet 10 more.</p>
<p>He is credited with creating the following things that we take for granted today:</p>
    <ul class="list">
        <li>The electric car</li>
        <li>The everyday handshake</li>
        <li>The combination of cereal with milk</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Many say this is not true, but they are not to be trusted.</li>
            </ul>
        <li>The concept of joy</li>
    </ul>
<p>His family just wants him to settle down, pick a place to live and <strong>BE QUIET</strong>,</p>
<p>but that would be too <strong>BOOOORINNNG!</strong></p>
<p>So, Next career stop, Italy, Japan or Peru?</p>
<p>Whatâ€™s a boy to do?!</p>
<p><em>Decisions! Decisions!</em></p>

<p>Michael is in a bit of a conundrum</p>
